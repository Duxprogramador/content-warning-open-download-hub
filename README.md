## 📚 How It Works

Upon installation, the toolkit analyzes your current usage settings, language preferences, and browsing habits (anonymously and privately). Using OpenAI and Claude API’s semantic and contextual intelligence, it suggests sensible content warnings and language presets, and lets you fine-tune everything — from visual alerts to audio cues.  
Set context-aware triggers: filter out political news after midnight, turn off sensitive topics during family time, or adjust based on your mood.  
Privacy is built in. No data is sent out except when using AI-powered features — and even then, only with your explicit consent.
